the monster attacked from the darkness from its hiding place quietly and with
premeditation it materialised suddenly from the darkness like a fiery explosion like a
tongue of flame
geralt though surprised reacted instinctively he dodged to the side brushing up against
the wall of the dungeon the beast flew by and bounced from the stone wall like a ball
waved it wings and jumped again hissing and opening its horrible beak
but this time the witcher was prepared
he struck with a short attack from the elbow aiming at the throat the red flap of the
gizzards he succeeded he felt the blade penetrate the body the momentum of the blow
knocked the monster onto the floor near the wall the skoffin howled with a cry that almost
sounded human it threw itself among the broken bricks flapping its wings spewing blood
and thrashing its tail around like a whip the witcher was sure the fight was over but the
nasty monster gave him an unpleasant surprise it unexpectedly launched at his throat
screeching showing its claws and snapping it beak geralt jumped bouncing his shoulder
against the wall and launched a blow from below using the momentum of the bounce he
was successful the skoffin fell once more between the bricks its fetid blood spilled down
the dungeon wall forming a fanciful pattern the monster shook screeched and stretched its
long neck its throat swell and shook the blood flowed rapidly from it and disappeared
among the bricks where it lay
geralt could easily finish it off but he did not want to destroy the skin he waited calmly
until the skoffin bleed to death he moved a few steps away undid his pants and took a piss
while whistling a nostalgic tune
the skoffin was silent and still the witcher moved closer to it and nudged it carefully
and gently with the tip of his sword seeing that it was over he grabbed the monster by the
tail and held it up he held the base of the tail at the height of a humans waist the skoffins
sharp beak reached the ground its wing span was just over four feet
youre not particularly heavy geralt shook the monster that weighed no more than a
fattened turkey fortunately for me i get paid per piece not by weight
wow reynart boisde fresnes whistled through his teeth which for him geralt knew
meant the highest expression of astonishment and admiration this is the first time i have
seen something like this with my own eyes a true monster on my honour so this is the
dreaded basilisk
no geralt lifted the monster a little higher so the knight would see better it is not a
basilisk it is a cockatrice
so what is the difference
the essentials the basilisk is also known as the regulus is a reptile the cockatrice also
called a skoffin is an ornithosaur  that is half reptile half bird it is the only representative
of the subclass which scientist call ornithoreptilia and after long disputes they came to the
conclusion that
and which of the two reynart boisde fresnes interrupted apparently without interest
of the discussions of scientists can kill or turn a man to stone with a glance
none those are stories
then why are people so afraid this thing here isnt so large can it be so dangerous
this thing here geralt shook the dead monster usually attacks from behind and
without error goes perfectly between the vertebrae or the aorta or under the left kidney
usually all it takes is a single thrust of its beak with regards to the basilisk it will kill you no
matter where it bites it has the strongest know poison which is a neurotoxin that kills within
a few moments
brrr tell me which one can you kill with a mirror
all of them if you slam it hard enough in the head with the mirror
reynard boisde fresnes burst out laughing geralt did not laugh the joke about the
basilisk and the mirror was one the teachers in kaer morhen repeated often equally funny
were the jokes about virgins and unicorns there was also a story of foolishness about a
young witcher from kaer morhen who made a bet to shake hands with a dragon
he smiled memories
i prefer it when you smile reynart said watching him carefully like you are at this
moment not like back in october when we first met in the druidic woods back then you
were gloomy bitter and resentful at the world like a moneylender who had been cheated and
on top of that like a man who throughout the night has come to nothing even in the
morning
really i was like that
really so do not be surprised that i prefer you such as you are now changed
therapy through work geralt again shook the cockatrice he held by the tail the
beneficial effects of exercise on mental health and to continue the therapy ill get straight to
business the skoffin can earn more than the agreed upon price for capture there is little
damage to it so you could take it to a taxidermist for stuffing but do not take less than two
hundred for it if you have to sell it in pieces remember that the most valuable feathers are
those above the tail especially these the central rudders they are far softer than those of a
goose and write very nicely and cleanly with little wear an experienced scribe will not
hesitate to give you five per pen
i have clients to collect the body the knight smiled the guild of coopers they saw in
castel ravello that stuffed ugly thing that monster or whatever you call it then you the
day after saovine went into the basement and killed it
i remember
now the coopers had seen that stuffed ugly bitch and asked me about obtaining a similar
rarity to decorate their guild hall in toussaint the coopers cannot complain about a lack of
work and as a result they are prosperous so they will not think much if we charge two
hundred and twenty for the cockatrice maybe even a bit more if we try to haggle in regards
to the feathers they are not going to know if we took some feathers from the things ass to
sell to the county chancery the chancery does not pay out of pocket but the county will pay
cash without haggling not five but ten per pen
i bow to your cunning
nomen omen reynard borisde fresnes smile broadened my mum must have known
something baptising me after the sly fox from the nursery rhyme
you should be a businessman not a knight
i should agreed the knight but if you are born the son of a knight you will die the son
of a knight and will sire another knight and it does not change even if you are broke you
know how to count geralt and the culture of the market
no not culture for similar reasons as yours with the sole difference that i wont be
siring anything lets get out of these dungeons
outside beneath the walls of the castle the frost stung and the wind blew from the
mountains the night was a clear and cloudless sky full of stars and the moonlight sparkled
on the fresh snow
the waiting horses snorted in welcome
we could go directly to my customer and make a deal said the knight but you
probably need to get to beauclair huh to a certain bedroom
geralt did not answer because he did not respond to such questions on principle he tied
the cockatrice onto the back his horse then mounted roach
we will visit the customer he said the night is still young and im hungry i would
also like to drink something lets go to town to pheasantry
the knight laughed and adjusted the red and gold chequered shield hanging on the high
saddle so he could scramble up
as you wish my friend we go to pheasantry forward mount
they went down the slope to the road lined by a row of poplars
you know what reynart geralt suddenly said i like you as you are now speaking
normally back when we first met you used annoying moronic mannerisms
upon my honour witcher i am a knighterrant chortled the reynart borisde fresnes
have you forgotten knights always talk like morons it is as much a part of their character
as this shield here thanks to the speech and the coat of arms we know who belongs to the
brotherhood

on my honour said the checkerboard knight you are unnecessarily troubled sir
geralt your companions have certainly returned to health and their injuries forgotten the
duchess has palace doctors in profusion able to cure every disease on my honour there is
more to discuss
i am of the same opinion said regis lighten up geralt after all the druidess healed
milva
and the druidess is familiar with treatments cahir interjected the best example is my
own head look it is as good as new milva is certainly healthy already there is no reason
for concern
i hope so
healthy already repeated the knight i bet that when we return we will find her
dancing at all the balls feasting in beauclair at the court of the duchess anarietta there is
always continuous dancing and feasting ha ha on my honour now that i have fulfilled my
knightly vow i am
you have completed your vow
i was in the favour of fortune i would like to explain that i made an oath and not just
any oath but on the heron in spring i vowed to apprehend five hundred malefactors before
yule i have completed this so i am relieved i can once again drink and eat beef and i do
not have to hid my name let me introduce myself i am reynart borisde fresnes
a pleasure to meet you
you were talking of balls angouleme said urging her horse up next to them i hope
that there will be enough food and drink for us and i would gladly dance
on my honour at the court of duchess anna henrietta there will be plenty of both said
reynart borisde fresnes singing and feasting and performances by jugglers theatre
music dancing and poetry in the evenings youre friends of dandelion i man the
viscount julian and he is very dear to her belovedness our lady duchess
and how long he boasted angouleme said was there truly an affair with them both
do you know the story sir knight tell us
angouleme said the witcher do you need to know
i do not need to but i want to leave off the protesting geralt and stop looking so
annoyed otherwise the mushroom pickers will have nothing to do because the sight of your
mouth will spoil the mushrooms on the roadside and you sir knight tell me
the other errant knights who rode at the head of the procession sang a song with a
repeated refrain the words of the song were almost unbelievably stupid
it happened began the knight six years ago the poet was a guest at the court during
the winter and spring playing his lute singing romances and declaiming poems prince
rajmund was at the time in cintra for the congress he was in no hurry to get back home
there was no secret that he kept a courtesan in cintra the duchess anarietta and mister
dandelion well beauclair is a special magical place where love works like a powerful
spell on people im sure youll notice this the duchess got to know the troubadour
maybe they did not even know it was happening  the poems compliments flowers words
glances and sighs to cut a story short they both became too close
how close laughed angouleme
i was not an eyewitness the knight said stiffly and it is not suitable to pass on gossip
moreover you should know at your age my dear that love has many names ultimately men
can be attracted to women body to body
cahir snorted softly angouleme has nothing to add
they met in secret for about two months continues reynart borisde fresnes from
belleteyn in midsummer over time however they forgot prudence rumours spread and
vicious talk of them did not leave them alone mister dandelion did not stay and hurriedly
left the principality it soon became clear how wise that was for barely had he left before
prince rajmund returned from cintra and a servant told him everything the prince when
he had heard of the insult that had been made against him as you can imagine fell into a
severe rage he threw his bowl of soup on the table slit the informers throat with a knife and
roared words of little decency then he hit the marshal in the face and broke his teeth and
then in front of witnesses broke a wonderful mirror from kovir into pieces the duchess was
sent under arrest to her quarters and was threatened with torture to extract what had
happened after that he commanded that his soldiers pursue mister dandelion and to kill him
without mercy and cut his heart out of his chest inspired by some old ballads he had
thoughts to fry the heart and force duchess anarietta to eat the heart in front of the whole
court ugh disgusting thankfully mister dandelion managed to disappear over the border
in time
thankfully then the prince died
he died the incident as i was told brought his blood to the boil it is said that he had
apoplexy and became paralysed he lay for nearly half a year like a log but then he was fine
he stood on his feet again and walked but with squinty eyes like
the knight turned in his saddle screwed up his eyes and grimaced like a monkey
while prince rajmund he continued had always been renowned as a womanizer with
the squint he became even greater at fornicating because every woman was thinking that he
was winking in a sign of love for her and quite a few females enjoyed the princes attention
i am not saying that all the weaker sex in toussaint are greedy with loose morals but as the
prince winked almost eternally the majority of those women came out on top but in the end
trying to keep up with all this mischief one night the apoplexy stuck him again he breathed
his last in the bedroom
on top of a girl laughed angouleme
indeed the normal serious knight smiled behind his moustache in truth he was
beneath her but there is no need to go into details
it stands to reason that you do not cahir said seriously though i think there wasnt a
lot of mourning for prince rajmund during your story i got the impression
that the unfaithful wife will be more loved that the cheating husband interrupted the
vampire in his usual way which is perhaps why she rules now
that is one reason why reynart borisde fresnes answered with a disarming sincerity
but not only that prince rajmund to put it mildly was dishonest a villain and forgive me
a motherfucker that would cause the devil himself an ulcer in six months and toussaint
suffered under his rule for seven years but duchess anareitta is adored by the people
so we do not have to worry geralt asked sourly that the deceased prince rajmund left
anyone who would honour him by putting a dagger into our friend dandelion
you do not have to worry the knight looked at him understandingly on my honour
nothing will happen to him as i told you our lady is devoted to the poet and anarietta
would make mincemeat out of anyone who tried to harm him
the good knight returns
when the war is over
not expecting his beloved
has now been married
hey ho ho
thats the knights fate
alarmed by the knights singing a flock of screaming crows took flight from the trees
lining the roadside
soon they left the forest into a wide valley between the hills on which the towers of a
palace shone white against the blue sky as far as the eye could see the gentle hills were
covered in neatly trimmed hedges and bushes the ground beneath the bushes was lined with
red and yellow leaves
what is that angouleme asked grapevines
grapevines confirmed reynart borisde fresnes the famous valley of sansretour
the worlds most excellent wine is made from the grapes that grow here
true said regis who as usual knew everything due to the volcanic soil here and the
local microclimate that provides the ideal amount of sunny days with annual precipitation if
we add to this tradition the knowledge and care from the workers of the vineyard the
resulting product is a superior quality brand
well put the knight smiled quality and brand oh look for example on the slopes
below the palace in this region we give names to the wines and vineyards this is called the
castel ravello and its wines come from vineyards such as erveluce the fiorano the famous
pomino and est est surely you have heard of it a barrel of est est wine is tenfold as much
as you would pay for a barrel from the cidaris vineyard of alba and there oh look you can
see other castles and vineyards but the names will probably be too foreign to you
vermentino toricella casteldaccia tufo sancerre nuragus coronata and finally corvo
bianco which the elves call gwyn cerbin i take it these names are foreign to you
foreign ha said angouleme you especially need the knowledge so that a rogue
innkeeper does not pour one of these wines and not ordinary plonk otherwise more than once
i would have had to leave my horse as a pledge of what est est wine would cost this stuff
might be great for lords but we the ordinary people the cheaper the better and i can tell you
this for ive experienced both  puking is the same whether youve had est est wine or cheap
wine

dont judge us on our cheap wines angouleme reynart said sitting at a bench behind
a table well bring you a quality brand and a good year we can afford to weve earned it
we can treat ourselves to our hearts content
of course geralt said waving to the innkeeper dandelion sometimes says that there
are other motivations for making money but can never recall what i want to taste what is
making those tempting smells from the kitchen anyway i did not expect at this late hour
pheasantry would have this many guests
but today is the feast of yule said the innkeeper who had heard his words people are
celebrating having fun having fortunes read according to tradition
i know the witcher interrupted and in the kitchen what tradition are you preparing
today
smoked tongue and horseradish capon broth with meatballs roast meat dumplings and
sauerkraut
bring it quickly my good man and for what do we ask for reynart
with meat thought the knight well have a red cote de blessure the year that the
old countess caroberta kicked the bucket
a wonderful choice the innkeeper nodded at your service gentlemen
a spring of mistletoe thrown over the shoulder of one of the girl at a neighbouring table
fell into geralts lap the celebrating company laughed and the girl blushed prettily
none of that the knight threw the spring back this is not your chosen one he is
already busy gracious lady he is already captivated by certain green eyes
shut up reynart
the innkeeper brought the ordered food and drink and then they ate and drank in silence
watching the surrounding festivities
yule geralt said thoughtfully placing his cup on the table midinvaerne the winter
solstice im stuck here for two months two months lost
one month reynart corrected him soberly if you lose anything then it is only one
month the snow will cover the mountain passes and you will not be able to leave toussaint
you will have to stay here during yule and probably until spring because it will be in vain to
waste tears on force majeure in any case do not go overboard with the sadness and grief i
do not believe that they are sorry for you
what do you know reynart what do you know
not much replied the knight pouring not much more than what i see and i saw your
first meeting you and her in beauclair remember the festival of the vat the white
underwear
geralt did not answer remembering
our castle in beauclair is magical its charms act powerfully on people muttered
reynart sipping wine and rolling it over his tongue the view alone is able to charm i
remember how you gasped when you saw it in october cahir show us what expression he
used then

a spectacular castle cahir said with admiration on my soul it is admirable and
pleasing to the eye
a pretty place your duchess lives said regis this has to be our stop
a fucking nice place angouleme added
palace beauclair reynart boisde fresnes said proudly an elvish building only
slightly modified and redesigned apparently by faramond himself
no doubt said the vampire there is no doubt the faramond style is evident at first
glance just look at those towers
the towers slender white obelisks that regis pointed to rose high above the red roofs to
the sky at first sight they resembled candles with wax cascading down to the masterfully
decorated base
at the foot of beauclair the knight reynart explained lies the city the wall of
course was added later after all elves do not build walls around a city spur your horses
gentlemen we still have a long way to go beauclair looks close but the mountains throw off
perspective
lets go
on the way to the city they overtook carts and wagons lots of carts and wagons  all full
of grapes they entered the noisy and grape scented streets of a city park after dark full of
poplar yew and barberry they passed roses mostly multiflora varieties and centifolia
finally they stood before the carved columns and portals of the palace were stood soldiers
and footmen in livery
among those that greeted them was dandelion combed and dress like a prince

where is milva
its okay dont worry she is sitting in the chambers which were prepared for you and
does not want to move from there
why
well talk about that later now come the duchess is waiting
right now
that was her wish
the hall into which they entered was full of people as colourful as birds of paradise
geralt did not have time to look around because dandelion pushed him towards a marble
dais on which stood two women significantly differing from the surrounding society
it was quiet but it grew quieter
the first of the women had a sharp slightly raised nose and penetrating blue eyes that
seemed feverish her auburn hair was adjusted in a perfect and truly artistic style tied with
silk ribbons and submitted to the last detail  including flawless crescent curls on her
forehead the bodice of her dress was cut deep and interwoven with pale blue and iridescent
purple stripes on a black background with a dense and regular design of small embroidered
gold chrysanthemums her neck was adorned with a mesh of extremely complex goldsmiths
work  a necklace of emeralds onyx and lapis lazuli the lowermost edge was completed with
a jade cross located between her breasts bound by the tight bodice it seemed that the fragile
shoulders of the woman would not generate sufficient support for her broad and deep
cleavage and that at any moment her breast might slip out however they remained in place
kept in position by the secret mysteries of dressmaking and the buffers of puffy sleeves
her companion was more or less the same height and had lipstick on her lips the same
colour but thats where the similarity of the two women ended the other wore her hair
cropped short in a lace cap trimmed with a muslin veil reaching to the tip of her nose the
flower motif of the veil could not conceal her large lustrous eyes highlighted with green
shadow the same floral veil covered a very modest neckline of a black dress with long
sleeves the dress was seemingly randomly decorated with gold stars embroidered with tiny
cut aquamarines and mountain crystals
her ladyship the duchess anna henrietta kneel sir said someone whispering behind
geralt
i wonder which one thought geralt who with effort bent his sore knee in a ceremonial
bow ill be damned if they both dont look royal
arise sir geralt the lady with the auburn hair and slightly raised nose dispelled his
doubts i welcome you to castle beauclair in the principality of toussaint i am delighted to
be able to host those who are carrying out such a noble mission moreover youve also been
a friend to our dear viscount julian
at these words dandelion bowed deeply
the viscount continued the duchess has revealed to me your names and the reason
and purpose of your mission and told me what brings you to toussaint his story touched my
heart i am going to give you a private audience sir geralt it will have to be delayed a small
while as i am saddled with state requirements the harvest is complete and tradition requires
our participation in the feast of the vat
the woman in the veil at the duchesss side leaned forward and whispered something
quickly anna henrietta looked at the witcher smiled and licked her lips
it is my desire she raised her voice that during the festival alongside viscount julian
geralt of rivia will serve us
a murmur swept through the group of courtiers and knights like the rustling of wind
through the pines the duchess anarietta gave the witcher one last glance and left the room
with her companion and retinue of pages
damn said the chessboard knight that is a surprise you have received a great
honour sir geralt
im not too clear what it was said geralt how should i serve her grace
her belovedness corrected a nobleman with the appearance of a confectioner im
sorry sir to correct you but i have to meet obligations we in toussaint adhere to tradition
and protocol i am sebastian le goff chamberlain and marshal of the palace
pleased to meet you
the official title of lady anna henrietta said the chamberlain who not only looked
like a confectioner but even smelled like icing is your enlightenedness and unofficially
lady duchess for outside of court but you should always address her as your
belovedness
thank you ill remember that and the other lady how do i title her
her official title is venerable the chamberlain instructed him seriously but it is
possible to address her as maam she is a relative of the duchess called fringilla vigo
according to the will of her belovedness it is lady fringilla that you will serve at the
festival
and what is involved with this service
nothing complicated let me tell you long ago we used mechanical presses for grapes
but the tradition
the courtyard resounded with the hum and trills of pipes flutes and the fierce clatter of
drums and tambourines on stage in the middle of the courtyard stood a huge vat in which
jugglers and acrobats jumped around doing flips and somersaults the courtyard and the
galleries were crowded with spectators  ladies nobles knights burgesses merchants and
common people
sebastian le goff lifted a staff entwined with vies and tapped it three times on the
pavement
ho ho he called noble ladies and gentlemen knights people
ho ho replied the crowd
ho ho this is an ancient custom let the vines thrive ho ho let the sun ripen them
ho ho let them ripen
ho ho let them ferment let them take strength and flavour from the barrels let it
change into wine let it flow into our cups and raise them to the honour of our majesty the
beautiful ladies brave knights and industrious winemakers
ho ho cheers
let them beauties come forward
from a damask tent on the opposite side of the courtyard stood two women  duchess
anna henrietta and her darkhaired companion both were shrouded in long scarlet cloaks
let the young come forward
the young were instructed in advance what to do dandelion went to the duchess and
geralt stepped out to meet the darkhaired companion which he knew as fringilla vigo
both women dropped their cloaks and the crowd rose in a thunderous ovation geralt
swallowed
the women were wearing sleeveless white shirts made of thin spiderweb like fabric
which did not even reach to their thighs and lacy panties and nothing more not even
jewellery and they walked barefoot
geralt offered fringilla his arm she willingly embraced him around the neck she
smelled of roses and amber her body was warm and soft
the women were brought to the vat geralt with fringilla and the duchess with
dandelion and helped to stand up in the grape juice the crowd roared
ho ho
anarietta and fringilla stood facing each other and laid their hands on each others
shoulders to more easily maintain balance among the grapes which rose to above their knees
juice spat and sprayed the women spun around inside the vat and laughed like kids
fringilla shot the witcher a playful wink
ho ho shouted the audience let then ferment
juice flowed and bubbled about the calves of the females
the chamberlain struck his staff on the pavement geralt and dandelion approached and
help the women get out of the vat geralt saw anarietta nibble on the troubadours ear when
he lifted her in his arms her eyes glittered dangerously he himself felt fringillas lips brush
his cheek but could not swear whether by accident or intentionally the strong smell of wine
hit him in the head fringilla stood on the stage and wrapped herself in a scarlet cloak the
brunette squeezed his hand strongly
these old traditions she said can be exciting right
yes
thank you witcher
the pleasure is all mine
not all of it i assure you

pour reynart
the company at the next table performed a more festive divination  throwing a chain of
peeled apple skins and guessing there future partners from the letter it resembled even
though practically every throw produced the letter s they continued to throw
the knight poured
milva it turns out said the witcher lost in thought is healthy though she still wears a
bandage around her ribs but she is sitting in her room refusing to exit because she does not
want to wear a bloody dress it seemed that the conflict was going to break protocol but the
situation was calmed by the omniscient regis citing a hundred precedents forced the
chamberlain to bring her some male clothes angouleme was happy for a change to get rid of
her pants and riding boots after some soap a comb and a dress she resembles a pretty girl
all of us seem to be in a better mood after a bath and clean clothes even me i was in a fairly
good mood when we went to the audience
wait a minute interrupted reynart and with a movement of his head indicated the
across the taproom we have some interest heading towards us ha not one but two
vineyards our customer malatesta is bringing his neighbour and competitor wonder of
wonders
who is the second
pomerol vineyards from there comes the cote de blessure the wine that we just drank
malatesta vermentinos vineyard administrator waved his arms and rushed over to them
the man he was leading had lush black hair and a black moustache like an outlaw rather than
an honourable citizen
allow me gentlemen malatesta said mister alcides fierabras pomerol vineyard
administrator
sit down please
just a minute mister witcher about the monster from our cellars by the fact that you are
here i assume the beast is slain am i correct
quite dead
the agreed upon sum malatesta assured him will be paid to your account with g later
today thank you very much mister witcher very few large wineries can boast such a large
cellar deep and spacious bearing to the north neither too dry nor too wet  just perfect for
wine it was a shame that it could not be used did you see for yourself the part of the cellar
when the monster managed to crawl through the devil knows from where probably
straight out of hell
the caves in volcanic tuffs often serve as havens for various monsters reynart
instructed importantly he had accompanied the witcher for more than a month and was a
good listener and learned things sure enough where there is a tuff youll find a monster
maybe the tuff malatesta squinted at him but people say its because our basement
connects with deep caverns that lead into the heart of the country such caves are numerous
in this country
you dont have to look far said the bearded pomerol also under our cellars are
corridors that stretch for miles and nobody knows where they end those who went to
explore never returned and there have been seen terrible monsters so i would ask
i can guess said the witcher what you would ask i accept i will examine your cellars
my fee is determined in accordance with this and what i come across
you will not regret it said the bearded man uh uh uh one more thing
speak im listening
the succubus that haunts the nights and torments men the one that the enlightened
duchess has ordered you to kill i think there is no requirement to kill her she bothers no
one to tell the truth oh sometimes we will visit when drunkto sometimes just try a
little
but only the adults malatesta added quickly
i had it on the tip of my tongue neighbour as i said the succubus harms no one and
lately even appears to be frightened of you mister witcher so why pursue her after all you
do not need the cash but if you are offended
you could help my account with gianfanelli geralt said with a straight face a witcher
pension fund
so be it
the succubuss blond head will not fall
and farewell both of the vineyard administrators stood up we will leave you in peace
and not disturb you this is a day of festival a tradition and here in toussaint a tradition
is
i know said geralt holy

the company at the next table should loudly with joy at a new divination which was
made by using a ball of pie dough and the bones of a fish drinking at the same time the
innkeeper and the wenches bustled about running with jugs
the famous succubus reynart said scoping more cabbage into his dish was one of the
first of the witcher contracts you accepted when you came to toussaint after that everything
move so fast and you couldnt get rid of customers the funny thing is i do not remember
which of the wineries gave you your first assignment
you were not there i happened the second day after the audience with the duchess the
audience where you were not needed
its no wonder it was a private audience
private spluttered geralt it was attended by about twenty people and that is not
counting the footmen who were motionless as statues pages young children and a boring
clown among those that i counted were le goff the chamberlain who would rather be a
confectioner there were several nobles bending under the weight of gold chains there were
a few cronies in black councillors maybe judges there was baron with a bulls head coat of
arms from caed myrkvid and fringilla of course who is obviously close to your duchess
and there was our bunch including milva in male attire oh we were poorly expressed it
was not our whole group we were missing dandelion dandelion or rather viscount julian
was lounging in a chair beside duchess anarietta and strutted like a peacock a royal
favourite only anarietta fringilla and dandelion sat no one else was allowed to sit even
so i was glad we did not have to kneel the duchess listened to me very intently but
fortunately she jumped only a few times during my talk when i finally briefly recounted my
conversation with the flaminica she anxiously wrung her hands the gesture was as sincere
as it was exaggerated it probably sounds like an absurd contradiction in terms but trust me
reynart it was precisely so

oh oh oh sighed the duchess anna henrietta wringing her hands your story
distresses me mister geralt it seizes my heart with sadness
she sniffled her nose and reached out her hand dandelion at once placed a cambric
handkerchief embroidered with a monogram into it the duchess touched the handkerchief
lightly to her cheeks so as not to remove her makeup
oh oh she repeated so the druids know nothing of ciri were they not able to offer
help were all your efforts in vain as the outcome of your journey
surely not in vain he answered i recognise that i did not get any concrete information
from the druids or any clues albeit only the most vague to explain why ciri had become the
object of such fierce persecution the druids however could not or would not help in that
case i really did not learn anything new but
he paused for a moment not to be dramatic but just to wonder if he could speak frankly
in from of the whole gathering
i know ciri lives he said dryly probably was injured and is still in danger but she
lives
anna henrietta sighed again and took the handkerchief from dandelion again
i promise you our help and support she said stay in toussaint as long as you wish
you should know that i used to visit cintra i knew and cultivated a friendship with pavetta
and knew and loved little ciri i am with you wholeheartedly mister geralt if necessary you
will have the assistance of our scholars and sorcerers the doors of our library and bookstores
are open to you i believe that we can find some clue some sign or indication to point you on
the right track do not act hastily you need not hasten you can stay here as a welcome guest
as long as necessary
i thank you for your kindness and grace geralt bowed however we must continue on
the road ciri is still in danger and we are also in danger when we stop for too long in one
place the danger not only grows but begins to threaten the people around us i will not allow
this
the duchess was silent for a while stroking dandelions forearm with a rhythmic
movement like a cat
your words are noble and honest but you do not have to worry here the villains that
stalked you were crushed by my knighthood so that none escape so i have been briefed by
viscount julian and one who dares cross your path better be careful you are under my
protection
i appreciate that geralt swept another bow and cursed his sore knee in spirit and not
just his knee however i must not conceal what viscount dandelion has forgotten to tell
you the rogues who chased me to belhaven and the one that the brave knights beat in caed
myrkvid were indeed rogues from the guild of illustrious rogues but also wore the colour of
nilfgaard
and what of it
well this was the tip of the force of nilfgaardians that conquered aedirn in twenty days
and they could do the same to you duchy in twenty minutes
it is a war he insisted what happened in the woods of caed myrkvid and belhaven
maybe regarded as rebellion and disruption to the rear of the imperial troops something like
that usually causes repression in a state of war
the war interrupted the duchess lifting her nose in the air has undoubtedly been
revoked i wrote of this matter to my cousin emhyr var emreis in my letter i asked him
firmly to stop the senseless bloodshed the war has ended and there has definitely been a
peace agreement
not so geralt said calmly across the yaruga roam sword and fire blood is being
spilled there is no indication that the war was to end rather the opposite
he immediately regretted what he said
how is this possible the duchesss nose lifted even higher her voice became harsh
did i hear right the war continues why were we not told about this minister tremblay
excellency i one if the nobles in gold chains fell to his knees i did not want to
worry upset highness
guards she screamed to the tower with him youre fallen out of favour mister
tremblay in disgrace lord chamberlain mister secretary
at your orders your grace
have our foreign minister immediately send a note to our cousin the emperor of
nilfgaard we demand that he immediately immediately cease fighting and sign for peace
for war and discord are bad things discord ruins strength and harmony
your truth has clarity said the chamberlain so far he smelled like powdered sugar now
his face took on its colour
what are you still doing here gentlemen i have issued an order no go act
geralt looked around discreetly the noble and officials maintained their stone faces
similar incidents like this were nothing new at court he decided from now on he was just
going to agree with the duchess
anarietta took the handkerchief and touch the tip of her nose with it and smiled at geralt
as you can see she said your fears were in vain you have nothing to fear and can
stay here as long as you want
yes your excellency
in the silence you could clearly hear the worms chewing wood in the antique furniture
and the curse of one of the groom in the far courtyard dealing with a horse
we would also like to ask you something mister geralt anarietta interrupted the
silence since you are a witcher
at your service your excellency
it is a plea from the many of the virtuous ladies of toussaint a nightmare is troubling
their homes a spirit a demon in female form a succubus so shameless that we dare not
describe her tortures faithful and virtuous spouses she enters the bedrooms at night and
makes all kinds of knavery and abominable perversion that our modesty forbids us to speak
of you as an expert certainly know what it is
yes your excellency
the women on toussaint ask that you put an end to this indecency and i assure you our
infinite gratitude
thank you for your confidence your excellency

angouleme found the witcher and the vampire in the castle park both were enjoying a
walk and a quiet conversation
you will not believe she said you will not believe what i have to tell you but it is the
pure truth
speak
reynart de borisfresnes the checkerboard knight in addition to other knights are in
line at the county treasurers chamber and you know what for to collect his pay for this
month the line is at least half an archery field long and there are so many tabards the eyes
get tired when i asked reynart about it he said that a knighterrant shouldnt starve
what is so strange in all this
are you kidding a man becomes a knight for a noble calling not for a monthly salary
one does not exclude the other regis said seriously trust me angouleme
trust him angouleme geralt said drily stop running around the castle in search of
sensation go keep milva company she is in a terrible mood and should not be left alone
right auntie has her period and because of it is more angry than a wasp i think
angouleme
im going im going
regis and geralt stopped before a bed of slightly wilted centifolias yet they were unable
to continue their conversation from behind a greenhouse emerged a man dressed in an
elegant coat of sienna
good morning he bowed and wiped his knee with his biretta can i ask which of you
gentlemen praise be is the witcher named geralt famous in his trade
i am
my name is jean catillon i am the steward of the castel toricella vineyards the thing
is that we could use a witcher in the cellars i wanted to inquire if you were willing to
what is it
well began catillon because of this damn war merchants rarely come so inventories
increase and there are no new places in the cellars for the new barrels we thought that the
various caves and tunnels below the castle which are said to stretch across our country could
be expanded we found a suitable cave  large vaulted neither too wet or dry it would have
been good for the wine
so what the witcher could not stand it
it appears that there is a monster prowling in the cave it burned two people reducing
one to bones and the other one was left blind sir the monster spits or vomits some kind of
caustic lye or something
a solpuga said geralt also called a venenosera
here smiled regis you can see for yourself sir catillon that you are dealing with a
professional a professional it seems who has fallen from heaven and have you asked for
help from the famous local knights the duchess has a whole regiment of them and this is
precisely their kind of mission their reason for being
that is not their reason steward catillon shook his head their reason is to protect the
highways routes and passes because if the merchants dont reach here we would soon be
broke in addition our knights are brave and warlike  but only on horseback they wouldnt
go underground for anything and plus they are expensive
he stopped and was silent he had the look of a man who wanted to spit but couldnt
and a look of regret
they are expensive geralt finished for him but not particularly scathing take note
my good man that i am even more expensive its a competitive market but if we have a
contract ill dismount from my horse and go underground think about it but do not think
about it too long because i will not be in toussaint long
you surprise me regis said as soon as the steward had walked away has the witcher
in you suddenly been revived do you accept the contract are you going to hunt the
monster
i too am surprised geralt admitted frankly i reacted unconsciously impulsively
somehow i felt pulled to it but a bid can be rejected as too low lets get back to our
conversation
wait a minute regis said looking over his shoulder something tells me that youre
about to have more business
geralt cursed under his breath on a path lined with cypress two knights were walking
towards them he instantly recognised the first one the enormous bulls head on a field of
white snow could not be confused with any other shield the second knight tall grey with
nobly angular features like they were carved from granite had a cross with golden lilies on a
blue background stopping at the prescribed distance of two steps the knights bowed geralt
and regis bowed back the four of them remained in orderly silence by the tradition of
chivalry for the count of ten heartbeats
allow me gentlemen said the man with the bulls head shield to introduce baron
palmerin de launfal and i as you can remember am called
baron de peyracpeyran as if it was possible to forget
we have a case for the witcher said baron de peyracpeyran relative so to speak to
his professional work
speak
in private
i have no secrets from mister regis
but the noble lords have them the vampire smiled therefore if i may i will take a
look at that beautiful pavilion which is probably a secluded toilet lord de peyracpeyran
lord de launfal
bows were exchanged
im listening geralt broke the silence without thinking for a moment about waiting ten
heartbeats
its peyracpeyran lowered his voice and looked around fearfully the succubus the
spirit that haunts the night the duchess and ladies have asked you to destroy may i ask how
much you have been promised to kill the monster
im sorry gentlemen but it is a professional secret
we understand we understand said the knight with the cross of lilies it is clear that
we are dealing with an honourable man verily i fear that such a man will find insult with
our proposal but i must give it renounce this contract sir witcher please leave the
succubus alone we will not say anything to the duchess and the ladies and on my honour
we men of toussaint will exceed the amount of the ladies you would be amazed by our
generosity
your proposal said the witcher in a cold voice is in fact not too far from an insult
mister geralt palmerin de launfals face was hard and serious ill tell you what we
dare to propose ergo there is a rumour about you saying that you only kill those monsters
that are a threat a real threat not from imagination or from ignorance or prejudice let me
tell you that the succubus does not threaten or harm anyone oh she visits sleeping men
from time to time and mortifies a little
but only to adults peyracpeyran quickly added
the ladies of toussaint geralt said looking around would not be very happy if they
knew of this conversation nor would the duchess
we fully agree with you murmured palmerin de launfal we recommend the utmost
discretion there is no need to irritate the bigoted guardian of decency
open an account for me with one of the local dwarven banks geralt said slowly and
quietly and amaze me with your generosity but be advised that it is not easy to amaze me
we are still going to try peyracpeyran said confidently
they exchanged farewells
he returned to regis who of course had heard everything with his vampire hearing
now he said without smiling you can argue that it was an involuntary reflex and
inexplicable impulse but how do you explain that to an open bank account
geralt looked somewhere high above the tops of the cypress trees
who knows he said maybe well spend a few days here given milvas broken ribs it
may even be more than a few days maybe a couple of weeks it would not hurt if during this
time we gained some financial independence
so thats were there bank account with gianfanelli came from reynart de boisfresnes
shook his head well if the duchess finds out it will mean new changes in rank there
would be a new distribution of patents ha maybe id even get promoted on my honour its
a shame you do not have the qualities of a snitch tell me now of the famous banquet that
caused you so much joy i longed to take part in it to eat and drink but they sent me to the
border to a watchtower in the cold and grey mountains what despair the fate of a knight
the large and highly anticipated banquet geralt said was prepared with great care and
diligence we mainly had to find milva who had holed up in the stables and convince her
that her attendance at the banquet was essential and depended upon the fate of ciri and nearly
the whole world we almost forcibly compelled her to wear womens clothes then we had to
get angouleme to promise to behave as a wellbehaved young lady and to especially avoid
words like fuck and ass and when we finally got everything ready and to ensure our
success we downed a cup of wine your confectioner le goff appeared smelling like frosting
and puffing like a pigs bladder
